# About Me
Hi I'm 0xTurco and welcome to my blog! I am currenly a security engineer with an interest in Red Teaming.

I am very interested in Active Directory and love exploring the in's and out's of Active Directory.

Understanding the many attack techniques of attacking an Active Directory environment has really driven this passion and hope to one day contribute my own research.

I hope you find something interesting or learn something new on my blog.

Thanks for stopping by!
